npx mocha ./testing_frameworks/mocha.js

npx is a command-line tool that comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager) starting from version 5.2.0. It allows you to run Node.js executables or locally installed packages without having to install them globally or specify their full paths.

The primary purpose of npx is to execute a command or a package-specific script without the need for an explicit global or local installation. It looks for the executable or script in the local node_modules/.bin directory and executes it.
